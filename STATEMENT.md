This project was created to solve a simple but very common problem: our folders become messy over time. Whenever we download files or work on different assignments, everything gets dumped into one place—images, PDFs, documents, ZIP files, videos, and many more. Sorting all these files manually is boring and time-consuming, so I wanted to automate the whole process using Python.

The File Organizer Script is a small tool that automatically arranges the contents of any folder into separate categories. When I run the script and provide a folder path, it scans every file, checks the file extension, and then moves it into a relevant sub-folder like Images, Videos, Documents, Audio, Archives, Code, and so on. Anything that doesn’t match a known type is placed into an Others folder so nothing gets lost.

My main goal with this project was to build something simple, practical, and genuinely useful. It doesn’t rely on external libraries—only Python’s built-in modules (os and shutil), which makes it lightweight and easy to run on any system. This project also helped me understand file handling, directory operations, and automation in Python.

In short, this script brings order to a cluttered folder with one click, making everyday computer use a little easier and a lot more organized.
